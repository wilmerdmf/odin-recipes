This is my first project! I'm very excited about it

I'm going to rewrite the entire code! due I learned some CSS basics I'm gonna practice by getting some style on this page.

I'm done with the index page, I learned a lot on internet, I asked for help to fix some troubles I had but at the end it looks exactly as I wanted. 

Now I'm beginning with the other sections of the page.
