    <h1>Karaage Chicken</h1>

    <img src="../images/karaage.jpg" alt="Karaage">
    
    <p>Karaage is a <Strong>Japanese</Strong> cooking technique in which chicken is deep fried in oil. The process involves lightly coating small pieces of the meat with flour, or potato or corn starch, and frying in a light oil. The foods are marinated prior to coating.</p>
    <p>Karaage is often served alone or with rice and shredded cabbage. Perfect for a <strong>tasty lunch</strong></p>
    <p>Let's learn the method of frying that produce moist, flavorful, boneless, skinless chicken with a super-thin coating that's incredibly crispy and crunchy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
       
            <li>One clove garlic, finely grated.</li>
            <li>One tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger.</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>Three tablespoons sake</li>
            <li>One tablespoon mirin</li>
            <li>One teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>One teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>One pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>One teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>One teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>Two pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>One cup potato starch</li>
            <li>One quart canola oil, or as needed</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil, black pepper, cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in the marinade and mix until thoroughly and evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 10 hours.</li>
            <li>Set up your dredging station: Place a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. Add potato starch to a wide, shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with marinade. Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch until evenly coated. Shake off any excess starch and place chicken on the wire rack. Repeat to dredge remaining pieces.</li>
            <li>Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of starch, then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the outside is crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoyt it!</li>

        </ol>

    <h3>Extra tips</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>If you can't find mirin, you can use sake plus an extra teaspoon of white sugar. You can use cornstarch instead of potato starch, but don't use potato flour! It's not the same as potato starch.</li>
            <li>For crispier, darker karaage that's made in two steps and great for a party, try the double-fry method! Follow instructions to Step 6. Fry chicken as directed in step 7, but only fry for 1 ½ to 2 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool to room temperature. Finish by frying at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 2 more minutes. Chicken can be refrigerated until the second fry.</li>
