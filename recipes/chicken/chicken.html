    <h1>Chicken Fajitas</h1>
    
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpg" alt="Chicken Fajitas">

    <p>We can thank the cuisine of Tex-Mex for the classic fajita. Originally, the term referred to a grilled strip of meat served in a tortilla. 
    These days you can find steak, chicken, shrimp, or even <strong>vegetarian</strong> fajitas.</p>

    <p>Minimal prep and minimal cook time means these can be on your dining room table <strong>FAST</strong>. Top them off with sour cream, pico de gallo, 
    and guac.</p>

    <p>Perfect for a simple and <strong>delicious</strong> dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>1/2 cup of extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>About three limes.</li>
            <li>Tow teaspoon cumin.</li>
            <li>One teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts.</li>
            <li>Kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper.</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together 1⁄2 cup oil, lime juice, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Season chicken with salt and pepper, then add to bowl and toss to coat. Let marinate in the fridge at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, heat remaining tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until golden and cooked through, 8 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes, then slice into strips.</li>
            <li>Add bell peppers and onion to skillet and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add chicken and toss until combined. Serve with tortillas.</li>

    <h3>Extra tips</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>While we have standalone recipes for steak and shrimp there are a bunch of things you can sub into this one! If you like things spicy, subbing some or all of the bell peppers for something like poblanos or even jalapeños would be awesome.</li>
            <li>If you like a little extra spice on your fajitas go ahead and add some chili powder, cayenne, or paprika!</li>

        </ul>
