            <h2>Steps</h2>

                <ol>

                    <li>Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil, black pepper, cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
                    <li>Place chicken in the marinade and mix until thoroughly and evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 10 hours.</li>
                    <li>Set up your dredging station: Place a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. Add potato starch to a wide, shallow bowl.</li>
                    <li>Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch until evenly coated.</li>
                    <li>Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of starch, then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Put the chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until cooked through and the outside is crunchy and browned. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoyt it!</li>

                </ol>

            <h3>Extra tips</h3>

                <ul>

                    <li>If you can't find mirin, you can use sake plus an extra teaspoon of white sugar. You can use cornstarch instead of potato starch, but don't use potato flour! It's not the same as potato starch.</li>
                    <li>For crispier, darker karaage that's made in two steps and great for a party, try the double-fry method! Follow instructions to Step 6. Fry chicken as directed in step 7, but only fry for 1 ½ to 2 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool to room temperature. Finish by frying at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 2 more minutes. Chicken can be refrigerated until the second fry.</li>
