                <p>The arepa is a flat, dish-shaped, unleavened patty made 
                    of maize flour which can be grilled, fried, or even boil. 
                    Depending on what kind of meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner)
                    can be filled in <strong>many</strong> ways. If serving for breakfast, 
                    my favorite filling is scrambled eggs, or cheese, and ham. 
                    Now, if they are to be served for lunch or dinner, they go 
                    perfectly with chicken, beef, pork, tuna, or beans.</p>
                
                <p>The arepa is a pre-Columbian dish from the area that is now 
                    Venezuela, Panamá and Colombia. Instruments used to make 
                    flour for the arepas, and the clay slabs on which they 
                    were cooked, were often found at archaeological sites in 
                    the area.</p>

                <h6>About</h6>
                
                <p>Karaage is often cited to have been popularized in 
                    the 1920s by the Toyoken restaurant in Beppu, Japan. 
                    The method was popularized because of the food shortages 
                    in Japan after World War II, specifically for chicken. 
                    Chicken was already a popular meal, but using the Karaage 
                    method made it easier to cook, and provided a different 
                    way to eat chicken.</p>
                
                <p>The Japanese heavy battered frying technique used for 
                    fried chicken, “karaage”, has only been in Japan since 
                    the 1920s. It was originally introduced by the Chinese 
                    as a way of frying tofu for vegetarian meals and is 
                    unique as it uses soy sauce and rice wine in the 
                    cooking process.</p>

                <h6>About</h6>
                
                <p>A fajita, in Tex-Mex cuisine, is any stripped grilled meat 
                    with stripped peppers and onions that is usually served 
                    on a flour or corn tortilla. The term originally referred 
                    to skirt steak, the cut of beef first used in the dish. 
                    Popular alternatives to skirt steak include chicken and 
                    other cuts of beef, as well as vegetables instead of meat.</p>
            
                <p>The first culinary evidence of the fajitas with the cut of 
                    meat, the cooking style (directly on a campfire or on a 
                    grill), and the Spanish nickname goes back as far as the 
                    1930s in the ranch lands of South and West Texas.</p>
