                        <p>The arepa is a flat, dish-shaped, unleavened patty made 
                            of maize flour which can be grilled, fried, or even boil. 
                            Depending on what kind of meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner)
                            can be filled in <strong>many</strong> ways. If serving for breakfast, 
                            my favorite filling is scrambled eggs, or cheese, and ham. 
                            Now, if they are to be served for lunch or dinner, they go 
                            perfectly with chicken, beef, pork, tuna, or beans.</p>
                        
                        <p>The arepa is a pre-Columbian dish from the area that is now 
                            Venezuela, Panamá and Colombia. Instruments used to make 
                            flour for the arepas, and the clay slabs on which they 
                            were cooked, were often found at archaeological sites in 
                            the area.</p>

                        <p>Karaage is often cited to have been popularized in 
                            the 1920s by the Toyoken restaurant in Beppu, Japan. 
                            The method was popularized because of the food shortages 
                            in Japan after World War II, specifically for chicken. 
                            Chicken was already a popular meal, but using the Karaage 
                            method made it easier to cook, and provided a different 
                            way to eat chicken.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Japanese heavy battered frying technique used for 
                            fried chicken, “karaage”, has only been in Japan since 
                            the 1920s. It was originally introduced by the Chinese 
                            as a way of frying tofu for vegetarian meals and is 
                            unique as it uses soy sauce and rice wine in the 
                            cooking process.</p>

                        <p>A fajita, in Tex-Mex cuisine, is any stripped grilled meat 
                            with stripped peppers and onions that is usually served 
                            on a flour or corn tortilla. The term originally referred 
                            to skirt steak, the cut of beef first used in the dish. 
                            Popular alternatives to skirt steak include chicken and 
                            other cuts of beef, as well as vegetables instead of meat.</p>

                            meat, the cooking style (directly on a campfire or on a 
                            grill), and the Spanish nickname goes back as far as the 
                            1930s in the ranch lands of South and West Texas.</p>
